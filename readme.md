# Twitch Adblock solution

This is exactly what it says on the tin. A tool to circumvent the extreme measures put in place on twitch which actively blocks adverts. 

This does not need to be used if you are a medium/hard mode user, or using [this project made by me](https://github.com/RMED24/ublock-medium-list). As this will already be blocking the advertisements by default...

# How to use this?

In this case I am going to assume you have ublock origin installed already, and are a user who hasn't messed with the settings of uBO much. 

To begin, in the top right click on the uBO extension icon (you may need to click on the jigsaw piece first if you're using chrome), and this menu should pop up:

Click on the settings icon here (if you don't see this icon, keep clicking the 'more' button until you do see it)

The settings window should open in a new tab, which is great! On the settings tab at the top you want to enable 'I am an advanced user':

Now you want to go to the 'My rules' tab at the top and [copy all the text that is on this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMED24/twitch-ad-block/main/raw.txt). Once you've done that, paste that text into the bottom temporary rules in the box on the right:

At this point, you can click the 'save' button and the 'commit' button. The ending result should look something like this:

And it's done! Go to twitch and test if it works correctly. If it doesn't, let me know and I'll try to fix said issue.

If you use this method, I also emplore you to consider subscribing to the twitch streamers you watch regularly. As this would mean slightly reduced ad revenue from each person who uses this
